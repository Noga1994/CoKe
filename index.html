    <div class="about_me"><h2><p>
         Thank you for coming to my website. 
         <br> This is where I will be displaying all my projects and my resume. 
         <br> I am currently working on 
        finding a job where I can enhance my skills, learn more about the programs I am using, and
        try to master all the skills I have learned. 
        <br>I have a bachelor's degree in 
        software engineering from Devry University.
        <br> I am trying to build up a better portfolio on the projects I have done and thought this would be a great way to enhance my skills.

    <div class="coding"><h2><p>
    I enjoy working and trying to develop useful coding practices.
     <br>Some of my works are on my portfolio page with the code available to download. One of my favorite languages to code in is Python and I enjoy backend coding for fun. 
     <br>I am newer to the front end of coding but I do enjoy trying to make things look better. 
     <br>I am a new developer and I enjoy working on all my projects and doing side hustles with code to enhance my skill set.
